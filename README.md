## Unit 08 Project 1 Homework: Professional Materials
<br> 
For this assignment, we were told to update our Web Resposive Portfolio. With what we learned with CSS and Bootstrap, we were told to make a website that can we accessed with all devices. We were told two make 3 different html files, and add a navbar to the top of the page. Also, we were told to use the grid system. Update: I was able to make the layout look a little cleaner for 2 of the pages. Also, the form looks a lot better now on the contact.html. I did have a little trouble with the portfolio.html  grid system but I feel like I am happy with what I have so far.


## The Criteria is the following: 
- Submit an updated portfolio featuring project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.
- Submit an updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring project 1 and two exemplary assignments.
- Submit an updated resume
