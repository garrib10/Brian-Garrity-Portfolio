Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio
For this assignment, we were told to make a Web Resposive Portfolio. With what we learned with CSS and Bootstrap, we were told to make a website that can we accessed with all devices. We were told two make 3 different html files, and add a navbar to the top of the page. Also, we were told to use the grid system 


Directions
First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:


Create the following files files: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.


Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:


A navbar


A responsive layout


Responsive images




The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.


Screenshots are provided as a reference in the Assets/Images folder. Your app does not need to be exactly like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout.

Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).
